        <h1>Dream of Red Chamber</h1>
        <p><b>Dream of the Red Chamber</b> (Honglou Meng) or <b>The Story of the Stone</b> (Shitou Ji) is a Chinese novel composed by Cao Xueqin <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_Xueqin">[1]</a></sup> in the mid-18th century. One of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, it is known for its psychological scope, and its observation of the worldview, aesthetics, lifestyles, and social relations of 18th-century China.</p>

        <p>The intricate strands of its plot depict the rise and decline of a family much like Cao's own and, by extension, of the dynasty itself. Cao depicts the power of the father over the family, but the novel is intended to be a memorial to the women he knew in his youth: friends, relatives and servants. At a more profound level, the author explores religious and philosophical questions, and the writing style includes echoes of the plays and novels of the late Ming, as well as poetry from earlier periods.</p>

        <h2>Language</h2>
        
        <p>The novel is composed in written vernacular (baihua) rather than Classical Chinese (wenyan). Cao Xueqin was well versed in Chinese poetry and in Classical Chinese, having written tracts in the semi-wenyan style, while the novel's dialogue is written in the Beijing Mandarin dialect, which was to become the basis of modern spoken Chinese. In the early 20th century, lexicographers used the text to establish the vocabulary of the new standardised language and reformers used the novel to promote the written vernacular.</p>
